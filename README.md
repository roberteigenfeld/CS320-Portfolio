# CS320-Portfolio

## Overview
This project is a contact management system that allows users to create and manage contact information easily.

## How I Ensure My Code Is Functional and Secure
To ensure my code is functional and secure, I rely on thorough testing and validation. I write unit tests to check that each part of the program works correctly and integration tests to make sure everything works together as expected. I also validate user inputs to prevent errors and potential security issues, like injection attacks. Regular code reviews help me catch any vulnerabilities before they become a problem.

## How I Interpret User Needs
I interpret user needs by talking directly with potential users. I conduct surveys and interviews to gather their feedback on what they want from the program. This information guides my design decisions. I also welcome user feedback during development, which allows me to make adjustments based on their suggestions and ensure the final product meets their expectations.

## My Approach to Designing Software
When designing software, I start by clearly defining the problem and identifying what the users need. I create a structured plan using design patterns to ensure the system is modular and easy to maintain. I often use diagrams to visualize the design and communicate my ideas with others. Prototyping is an essential part of my process; it helps me test ideas with users early on, allowing me to refine the software based on their feedback.
